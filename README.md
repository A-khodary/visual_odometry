# Monocular Visual Odometry using Python

The project implements Mononocular Visual Odometry utilizing [OpenCV 3.1.0-dev](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) 
with the [opencv_contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib) modules.

## Project

The project used the [monoVO-python](https://github.com/uoip/monoVO-python) repository, which is 
a Python implementation of the [mono-vo](https://github.com/avisingh599/mono-vo) repository, as its backbone.
The code was optimized in order to make it more robust, using advance methods in order to obtain a 
higher level of accuracy. An in depth explanation of the fundamental workings of the algorithm maybe found 
in [Avi Sinhg's report](http://avisingh599.github.io/assets/ugp2-report.pdf). This [report]() provides 
information about the optimizations done to the monoVO-python code.
